## The Problem
Apex Legends is a battle royale game that was released in
February 4, 2019, As the game is still pretty new, there is a greate
need to track statistics and substatial information revolving
around the game. This will primarily help players to get more
viewers or be scouted by an esports org for future competitve
endeavors.
